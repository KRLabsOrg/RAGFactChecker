# Rag Fact Checking System

A Python library for validating the factual accuracy of Large Language Model (LLM) responses against their source documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The raw textual inputs are converted into triplets (subject, predicate, object) to represent the sentences and then fact-checked against the reference documents.

This library offers you sentence-level fact checking granularity, with the possibility to extract the exact incorrect triplet from an LLM response.

The generic way of how it works is as follows:
- Generate the triplets from the answer of the LLM
- Generate the triplets from the reference documents
- Compare the triplets from the LLM answer with the triplets from the reference documents
- If the triplets from the LLM answer are not present in the reference documents, it is a hallucination


**NB**: This fact-checking system was built and validated in https://huggingface.co/datasets/rag-datasets/rag-mini-bioasq dataset, specifically on the Thyroid topic. There is no guarantee that it will work for other datasets and might need more adjustments to be used for other datasets.

## Main Features

There are a couple of separate components in this library:

- **Triplet Generator**: Extracts factual relationships from the input text in the form of triplets, which consist of a subject, predicate, and object. This is done using LLMs.
- **Fact Checker**: Compares these triplets with those from a reference text to determine if they match (true/false).
- **Hallucination Generator**: An LLM generator that generates hallucinated triplets from the reference documents. This is done in order to synthetically generate a dataset of hallucinated triplets.

## Installation

This is a pip installable package. To install it, run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/KRLabsOrg/RAGFactChecker.git@main
```
	
## Usage

Below is a sample that shows how to import and use the `LLMTripletValidator` class to execute fact checking. The inputs are:
- `input_text`: The answer from the LLM
- `reference_text`: The reference documents which were fed to the LLM from the RAG system

```python
import os
from rag_fact_checker import LLMTripletValidator
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "your_openai_api_key")

triplet_validator = LLMTripletValidator(
  input_config = {"triplet_generator": "llm_n_shot", "fact_checker": "llm_n_shot"},
  openai_api_key=api_key
)

results = triplet_validator.validate_llm_triplets(
   input_text="The sky is green", 
   reference_text=["The sky is blue and the grass is green"]
)
```

Output:
```
DirectTextMatchOutput(
    input_triplets=[['The sky', 'is', 'green']], 
    reference_triplets=[['The sky', 'is', 'blue'], ['The grass', 'is', 'green']], 
    fact_check_prediction_binary={0: False} # this means that input triplet with idx 0 is incorrect
)
```


## Additional usages

Besides being used for fact-checking purposes only, the library can also be used for Information Extraction purposes - namely, given some text, to extract the triplets from it (all using LLMs).

```python
import os
from rag_fact_checker import LLMTripletValidator
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "your_openai_api_key")


triplet_validator = LLMTripletValidator(
    input_config = {"triplet_generator": "llm_n_shot", "fact_checker": "llm_n_shot"},
    openai_api_key=api_key
)

results = triplet_validator.triplet_generation(
    input_text="The sky is green and the Eiffel Tower is blue. The Eiffel Tower is in Paris."
)
```

Another usecase is to use it for synthetic hallucinated data generation.

```python
import os
from rag_fact_checker import LLMTripletValidator
api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "your_openai_api_key")

triplet_validator = LLMTripletValidator(
    input_config = {"triplet_generator": "llm_n_shot", "fact_checker": "llm_n_shot"},
    openai_api_key=api_key
)

results = triplet_validator.generate_hlcntn_data(
    question="Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor beta1 regulate in the liver?",
    reference_text=["The carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) and sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, regulated by liver X receptors (LXRs), play central roles in hepatic lipogenesis. Because LXRs and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) influence each otherâ€™s transcriptional activity, researchers investigated whether TRs control ChREBP expression. They found that thyroid hormone (T3) and TR-beta1 upregulate ChREBP by binding direct repeat-4 elements (LXRE1/2), thereby fine-tuning hepatic lipid metabolism."]
)
```


## Configuration

When creating the LLMTripletValidator, you can pass a dict to input_config to override default settings.
For example, to customize model names, logging level, etc.:

```python
custom_config = {
    "model": {
        "triplet_generator": {
            "model_name": "llm_n_shot"
        },
        "fact_checker": {
            "model_name": "llm"
        }
    },
    "logger_level": "DEBUG"
}
```

Available Models
- Triplet generator : "llm", "llm_n_shot"
- Fact checker : "llm", "llm_split", "llm_n_shot", "llm_n_shot_split"
- Logger level : "DEBUG", "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL", "NOTSET"
