# Rag Fact Checking System

A Python library for validating the factual accuracy of Large Language Model (LLM) responses against their source documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

This library offers you sentence-level fact checking and has the possibility extract the hallucinated triplet from an LLM response. It does so by using triplets (subject, predicate, object) to represent the sentences.

The generic way of how it works is as follows:
- Generate the triplets from the answer of the LLM
- Generate the triplets from the reference documents
- Compare the triplets from the LLM answer with the triplets from the reference documents
- If the triplets from the LLM answer are not present in the reference documents, it is a hallucination


## Main Features

There are a couple of separate components in this library:

- **Triplet Generator**: Extracts factual relationships from the input text in the form of triplets, which consist of a subject, predicate, and object. This is done using LLMs.
- **Fact Checker**: Compares these triplets with those from a reference text to determine if they match (true/false).
- **Hallucination Generator**: An LLM generator that generates hallucinated triplets from the reference documents. This is done in order to synthetically generate a dataset of hallucinated triplets.

## Installation

This is a pip installable package. To install it, run the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/KRLabsOrg/RAGFactChecker.git@main
```

## 3. Setting Your OpenAI API Key

You can pass the API key via the openai_api_key argument. However, `LLMTripletValidator` reads from the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` by default

To set `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable, create a `.env` file and add the following line to it: `OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"`

	
## Usage

Below is a sample that shows how to import and use the `LLMTripletValidator` class to execute fact checking:

```python
from rag_fact_checker import LLMTripletValidator
api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

triplet_validator = LLMTripletValidator(
  input_config = {"triplet_generator": "llm_n_shot", "fact_checker": "llm_n_shot"},
  openai_api_key=api_key
)

results = triplet_validator.validate_llm_triplets(
   input_text="some random text", 
   reference_text=["reference document 1", "reference document 2"]
)
```


## Example runs
```python
from rag_fact_checker import LLMTripletValidator

triplet_validator = LLMTripletValidator(
    input_config={"logger_level": "DEBUG"}, openai_api_key=api_key
)

triplet_validator.validate_llm_triplets(
    input_text="The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 and stands 324 meters tall. It was designed by Gustave Eiffel and has become the most iconic symbol of Paris. Millions of tourists visit it each year.",
    reference_text=["The Eiffel Tower, completed in 1889, is a wrought-iron lattice tower located in Paris, France. Standing at 324 meters tall, it was designed and built by engineer Gustave Eiffel's company. The tower attracts around 7 million visitors annually and has become the most recognizable landmark of Paris."],
)

Below is a sample that shows how to import and use the LLMTripletValidator class to generate triplets which is a list of subject, predicate, and object.

```python
from rag_fact_checker import LLMTripletValidator

triplet_validator = LLMTripletValidator(
    input_config = {"triplet_generator": "llm_n_shot", "fact_checker": "llm_n_shot"},
    openai_api_key=api_key
)

results = triplet_validator.triplet_generation(
    input_text="some random text"
)
```

## 7. Hallucinated Data Generation Only
Below is a sample that shows how to import and use the LLMTripletValidator class to generate triplets which is a list of subject, predicate, and object.

```python
from rag_fact_checker import LLMTripletValidator

triplet_validator = LLMTripletValidator(
    input_config = {"triplet_generator": "llm_n_shot", "fact_checker": "llm_n_shot"},
    openai_api_key=api_key
    )

results = triplet_validator.generate_hlcntn_data(
    question="Which genes does thyroid hormone receptor beta1 regulate in the liver?",
    reference_text=["The carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) and sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c, regulated by liver X receptors (LXRs), play central roles in hepatic lipogenesis. Because LXRs and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) influence each otherâ€™s transcriptional activity, researchers investigated whether TRs control ChREBP expression. They found that thyroid hormone (T3) and TR-beta1 upregulate ChREBP by binding direct repeat-4 elements (LXRE1/2), thereby fine-tuning hepatic lipid metabolism."]
    )
```


## Configuration

When creating the LLMTripletValidator, you can pass a dict to input_config to override default settings.
For example, to customize model names, logging level, etc.:

```python
custom_config = {
    "model": {
        "triplet_generator": {
            "model_name": "llm_n_shot" # Available values: "llm", "llm_n_shot"
        },
        "fact_checker": {
            "model_name": "llm" # Available values: "llm", "llm_split", "llm_n_shot", "llm_n_shot_split"
        }
    },
    "logger_level": "DEBUG"
}


fact_checking_system = LLMTripletValidator(
    question=custom_config,
    reference_text
    openai_api_key=None  # Uses the OPENAI_API_KEY from environment
)
```

Available Models
- Triplet generator : "llm", "llm_n_shot"
- Fact checker : "llm", "llm_split", "llm_n_shot", "llm_n_shot_split"
